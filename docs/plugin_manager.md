Plugin Manager
===================

** This is text copied from layout.md - it needs an image & more info about connect to the local plugin

In order to make Remix flexible for integrating changes into its functionality and for integrating remix into other projects (your's for example), we've now made everything a plugin.  This means that you only load the functionality you need.  It also means that you need a place to turn off and on plugins - as your needs change.  This all happens in the plug manager.  

The Plugin Manager is also the place you go when you are creating your own plugin and you want to load your local plugin into Remix. In that case you'd click on the "Connect to a Local Plugin" link at the top of the Plugin Manager panel.
